            <li>NARROW AI - Artificial intelligence is said to be narrow when the machine can perform a specific
                (single) task extremely well, even better than humans.</li>
            <br>
            <li>GENERAL AI - Artificial intelligence reaches teh general state when it can perform any intellectual task
                with the same accuracy level as a human would.</li>
            <br>
            <li>STRONG AI - Strong AI is a level of Intelligence of Systems in which machines could surpass human
                intelligence and can perform any task better than human with cognitive properties.</li>
