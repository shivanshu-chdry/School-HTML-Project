            <li>Computer systems replace outdated forms of paper communication and paper file storage. They are used as
                a way to store and manage large amounts of information digitally.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Computer databases are used to store, manage and analyze large amounts of information quickly and
                efficiently.</li>

            <li>Whenever we make the list of information, such as names, addresses, products or invoices, we are in fact
                creating a database.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Records kept in a computer do not necessarily make a database.</li>
            <br>
            <li>A database is much more powerful than a simple list you make on paper or in a MS Word Document.</li>

            <li>A database is a collection of data that is organized in a manner that can be easily retrieved.</li>
            <br>
            <li>One basic feature of the database is that the data is organized in a systematic way such as a tabular
                format.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Database consists of fields(single piece of information), records(one complete set of fields) and
                files(collection of records), much like a telephone directory.</li>
