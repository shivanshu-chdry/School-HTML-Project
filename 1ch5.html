            <li>Microsoft Access is a Database Management System (DBMS), a part of the Microsoft Office Suite.</li>
            <br>
            <li>MS Access is one of the most flexible and easy-to-use databases that allows user to create many
                applications without writing a single line of the code.</li>
            <br>
            <li>For something very powerful MS Access provides a powerful programming language i.e. Visual Basic for
                Applications (VBA)</li>

            <li>The main control center of each Access database is the Navigation Pane. It shows you what is in the
                database and makes the information accessible to you.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Also, you can choose to close the navigation pane, if you need more of the Access window to complete
                specific tasks.</li>

            <li><strong>TABLES</strong> - Tables are the fundamental objects in Access and are used to hold the raw data
                of the database.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>FORMS</strong> - Forms can be described as the 'face' of an application. They are customized
                screens that provide an essay way to enter, view and modify data.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>QUERIES</strong> - Queries are requested to extract relevant information from a table or tables.
                Queries can be based on table(s) or other queries. They can be used to select, change, add or delete
                records in the database.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>REPORTS</strong> - A Report is a properly presented and explanatory listing of the data printed
