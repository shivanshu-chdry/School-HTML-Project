            <li>Forms are the most flexible ways to view, edit and delete data.</li>
            <br>
            <li>MS-Access forms have some major advantages over the traditional paper forms as they save your time,
                effort and paper.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>SPLIT FORM</strong> - A Split Form is a form in which the same data is displayed in two views
                simultaneously. One part of the form will display a Form view, while the other part displays a Datesheet
                view.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>MULTIPLE ITEMS FORM</strong> - Multiple items form displays multiple records in a single window,
                one record per row instead of regular form where one record is displayed in a single window.</li>

            <li>It is a window or screen that contains numerous fields or spaces to enter data.</li>
            <br>
            <li>They are either based on table or query.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Form created from a table will let you view the records that are already in that table and you can also
                add new records.</li>

            <li>Queries allow you to pull information from one or more tables based on a set of search conditions you
                define.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Running a query is like asking a detailed question based on your database.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Queries are far more powerful than the simple searches or filters you might use to find data within a
                table.</li>
