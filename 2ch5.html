            <li>Access uses tables to define the structure of the data in your database.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Each table contains a collection of related information. Access makes it easy to construct tables.</li>

            <font color="tomato">WHAT IS A TABLE?
        </h2>
        </font>
        <font size="4" face="Arial" color="black">
            <li>A table in Access is quite different from the table in real life. Instead of having wooden legs and
                being used for meals.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Access Tables are a grid made up of rows and columns.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Tables forms an integral part of database and store all the relevant information.</li>
        </font>
        <h2>
            <font color="tomato">ELEMENTS OF A TABLE
        </h2>
        </font>
        <font size="4" face="Arial" color="black">
            <li>Any of the other database objects are optional but without a table there can't be a database.</li>
            <br>
            <li>They store the complete data in a structured manner. Tables are made up of groups of fields. A field is
                a specific type of information, such as a student's last name, address or phone number.</li>

            <font color="tomato">UNDERSTANDING PRIMARY KEY
        </h2>
        </font>
        <font size="4" face="Arial" color="black">
            <li>The power of relational database such as MS-Acces comes from its ability to quickly find and bring
                together information stored in separate tables using queries, forms and reports.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In order to do this, each table should include a field or a set of fields that uniquely identify each
                record stored in the table.</li>
            <br>
            <li>This unique field or set of fields is called the primary key of the table.</li>
            <br>
            <li>A primary key is a field or combination of fields that uniquely identify each record in a table.</li>
