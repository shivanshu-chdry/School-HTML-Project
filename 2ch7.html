            <li>Tags are coded commands used to indicate the way your Web page should be displayed on the browser.</li>
            <br>
            <li>HTML Tags begin with a left-angle bracket (<) and end with a right-angled bracket (>).</li>
            <br>
            <li>The first word between the angle brackets is the tag's name i.e. element in the browser command.</li>
            <br>
            <li>An element(tag) may also be followed by attributes, which are the words describing properties of the
                element and further instruct the browser specifically about that tag.</li>
            <br>

        <h2>
            <font color="tomato">ABOUT ATTRIBUTES
        </h2>
        </font>
        <font size="4" face="Arial" color="white">
            <li>An attribute is used to define the property or characteristics of an HTML tag and is placed inside the
                opening tag after tag name.</li>
            <br>
            <li>A tag is the basic 'item' and an attribute is some extra detail.</li>
            <br>
            <li>There are two types of tags:</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>CONTAINER TAG</strong> - Refers to a tag that contains an opening as well as a closing tag. The
                container tag always wraps around text or graphics and comes in a set i.e. with an opening and a closing
                tag.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>EMPTY TAG</strong> - Refers to a tag that contains only an opening tag and does not need a
                closing tag.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The forward slash (/) in the tag tells the browser that the tag has ended and it is a closing tag. On
                the other hand, the empty tag stands alone.</li>
