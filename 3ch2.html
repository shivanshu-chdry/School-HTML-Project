            <li>Deep learning can be considered as a subset of machine learning. It is a field that is based on learning
                and improving on its own by examining computer algorithms.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Deep learning is a key technology behind driver-less cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to
                distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost.</li>

            <li>The simplest definition of data science is the extraction of actionable insights from raw data.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Data Science helps you manage data, analyze it and create meaning for the data that we have.</li>
            <br>
            <li>All this is possible by applying data analytics to the data or information and then coming up with some
                meaning that is understandable by the end user.</li>

            <li>A neural network is a network or circuit of neurons or in a modern sense, an artificial neural network,
