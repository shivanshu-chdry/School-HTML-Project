            <li><strong><u>PEER-TO-PEER NETWORKS</u></strong> - Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are more commonly
                implemented where less then ten computers are involved and where strict security is not necessary.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong><u>CLIENT/SERVER NETWORKS</u></strong> - Client/server networks are more suitable for larger
                networks.</li>

        </h2>
        </font>
        <font size="4" face="Arial" color="white">
            <li><strong><u>SERVERS</u></strong> - Servers are faster computers that run various software, store and
                process information by providing an interface for the users to be able to utilize the networked
                computers.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong><u>NODES</u></strong> - Nodes are the computers on the network that are provided to the users in
                order to carry out their tasks using the network.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong><u>NETWORK INTERFACE CARD (NIC)</u></strong> - Network card is a necessary component of a
                computer without which a computer cannot be connected over a network.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong><u>HUBS / SWITCHES</u></strong> - When you connect multiple computers on a network, they all
                plug into a central device called a hub whereas Switches are really smart hubs such that they are able
                to build tables to keep track of which computer is on which switch port.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong><u>NETWORK OPERATING SYSTEM (NOS)</u></strong> - The network requires some software to control
                all the information transfer activity on the network, like the traffic police controls the traffic.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong><u>NETWORK CABLES</u></strong> - This is the medium or channel over which the information
                travels from computer to computer.</li>
