            standard, Captain in 4th standard and prefect since class 5th onwards. I believe in small peer group with
            atmost trust, fun and honesty. I

            in outdoor physical activities like Badminton and Cricket on regular basis. In the next 5 years I'm looking
            forward towards a better education approach by reaching a great college with progressive carrer opportunity.
